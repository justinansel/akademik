# Feature Specification: AI-Generated Learning Content

**Feature Branch**: `003-integrate-ai-content`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need to when the submit button is pressed call the OpenAI API I'm providing the sample of the code that I need you to integrate. This call should happen as the spinner is triggered so that way it's a loading indicator. Once the response comes back - THEN - you remove the spinner and show the mock audio player - you'll also see there's a line of text that says 'lyrics go here' - replace that content with the response from the API call. You'll need to pass the topic as the user prompt here as well."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: When a user submits a new topic while content generation is in progress, what should the system do? → A: Ignore the new submission until current generation finishes (input stays disabled)
- Q: When the generated content is very long (e.g., extensive lyrics or a long script), how should it be displayed? → A: Display all content, let page grow as tall as needed (full content always visible)
- Q: If the content generation service returns empty, incomplete, or inappropriate content, what should the system do? → A: Display generic placeholder content ("Content unavailable for this topic")
- Q: How long should the system wait for content generation before timing out and showing an error? → A: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Q: Should the system preserve special formatting in the generated content, or display it as plain text? → A: Display as plain text (strip all formatting, single continuous text block)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generate Learning Content (Priority: P1)

A user submits a learning topic and the system generates custom learning content (lyrics, script, or educational material) specifically tailored to that topic. The content generation happens in real-time while the user waits, and the generated content is displayed once ready. This transforms the placeholder experience into a functional learning tool that delivers actual educational value.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the application. Without real content generation, users only see a mock interface. This story delivers the primary functionality that makes the app useful.

**Independent Test**: Submit a learning topic, wait for content to be generated, verify that topic-specific educational content appears in the lyrics section. Verify content is relevant to the submitted topic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user submits a valid learning topic, **When** the submission occurs, **Then** the system begins generating content specific to that topic
2. **Given** content generation is in progress, **When** the user observes the interface, **Then** a loading indicator displays showing the system is working
3. **Given** the system is generating content, **When** the generation completes, **Then** the loading indicator disappears and is replaced by the audio player interface
4. **Given** the audio player interface appears, **When** the user views the content area, **Then** the generated learning content (lyrics/script) is displayed instead of placeholder text
5. **Given** generated content is displayed, **When** the user reads it, **Then** the content is relevant and specific to their requested learning topic
6. **Given** the user submits a different topic, **When** new content is generated, **Then** the previous content is replaced with new topic-specific content

---

### User Story 2 - Error Handling and Feedback (Priority: P2)

When content generation fails or encounters errors, the system provides clear feedback to the user and offers appropriate recovery options. Users understand what went wrong and know how to proceed, whether that means retrying, submitting a different topic, or contacting support.

**Why this priority**: Error handling is essential for production use but not required for initial MVP testing. This story ensures the application gracefully handles failures without leaving users confused.

**Independent Test**: Simulate various failure scenarios (network errors, service unavailable, invalid responses) and verify appropriate error messages and recovery options are presented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the content generation request fails, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the loading indicator is replaced with a clear error message
2. **Given** an error message is displayed, **When** the user reads it, **Then** they understand what went wrong in plain language
3. **Given** an error has occurred, **When** the user views their options, **Then** they can retry the request or submit a different topic
4. **Given** the network connection is lost, **When** generation is in progress, **Then** the system displays an appropriate timeout message after a reasonable wait
5. **Given** the service is temporarily unavailable, **When** the user attempts to generate content, **Then** they receive a message indicating they should try again later

---

### User Story 3 - Loading Duration Feedback (Priority: P3)

For content generation requests that take longer than expected, the system provides progress feedback or estimated time remaining to manage user expectations. Users understand that generation is still in progress and approximately how much longer they need to wait.

**Why this priority**: Enhanced loading feedback improves user experience but the basic loading indicator (from US1) is sufficient for initial release. This story adds polish for longer wait times.

**Independent Test**: Submit topics that generate longer content, verify progress indicators or time estimates appear, confirm users understand the system is still working.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** content generation takes longer than 5 seconds, **When** the user waits, **Then** additional progress feedback appears (e.g., "Still generating...", progress percentage, or estimated time)
2. **Given** progress feedback is displayed, **When** the user observes it, **Then** they can tell the system is still actively working and hasn't frozen
3. **Given** generation is taking extended time, **When** the user views the interface, **Then** they have the option to cancel the request if desired

### Edge Cases

- **Multiple rapid submissions**: If the user attempts to submit a new topic while content generation is in progress, the input field and submit button remain disabled, effectively ignoring the new submission until the current generation completes
- **Very long content**: When generated content is extensive (long lyrics or detailed scripts), the interface displays all content in full, allowing the page to grow vertically as needed for complete visibility
- **Empty or inappropriate content**: If the generated content is empty, incomplete, or inappropriate, the system displays a generic placeholder message ("Content unavailable for this topic") instead of showing problematic content
- **Generation timeout**: The system waits a maximum of 300 seconds (5 minutes) for content generation before timing out and displaying an error message to the user
- **Content formatting**: Generated content is displayed as plain text with all special formatting stripped, presenting content as a single continuous text block for simplicity

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Content Generation
