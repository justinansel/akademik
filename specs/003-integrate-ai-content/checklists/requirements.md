# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Generated Learning Content

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED - Ready for Clarification

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification describes the feature as "content generation service" and "generated learning content" without mentioning specific APIs, providers, or implementation technologies. Focuses on user experience of submitting topics and receiving relevant educational content. Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 19 functional requirements are clear and testable. Success criteria include measurable metrics (95% relevance, 30-second completion time, 85% success rate). Edge cases cover multiple submissions, content variations, errors, and timeouts. Assumptions document reasonable defaults for service behavior, content safety, and typical generation times.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Three user stories prioritized by importance (P1: core generation, P2: error handling, P3: enhanced feedback). Each story is independently testable with Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios. Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes like content relevance, generation speed, and error message clarity. No implementation details present.

## Notes

**Validation Status**: All checklist items passed on first validation. Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` command.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear separation between loading states and content display
- Integration with existing features (builds on 001 and 002)
- Comprehensive error handling scenarios
- User-focused success criteria (relevance, speed, success rate)
- Appropriate assumptions about service behavior and content safety

**Design Considerations Documented**:
- Real-time content generation replaces placeholder behavior
- Loading state leverages existing 2-second spinner infrastructure
- Content display handles varying lengths and formatting
- Error scenarios provide clear user feedback and recovery options

**No Issues Found**: Specification meets all quality criteria for proceeding to planning phase. Some edge cases may benefit from clarification during `/speckit.clarify` phase.
