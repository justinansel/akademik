# Specification Quality Checklist: Audio Generation and Playback

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED - Ready for Clarification

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification describes audio generation, mixing, and playback in user-experience terms without mentioning specific APIs, services, or technical implementations. Focuses on what users hear and experience (voice narration, background music, playback controls) rather than how it's implemented. Written for stakeholders who understand the desired outcome but not the technical approach.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 27 functional requirements are clear, testable, and technology-agnostic. Success criteria include measurable metrics (100% content coverage, 0% vocals in music, 95% intelligibility, 60-second generation time, 2-second playback start). Edge cases cover generation failures, mixing failures, playback errors, timeouts, and file management. Assumptions document reasonable defaults for audio quality, generation times, and technical capabilities.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Three user stories all at P1 priority (voice generation, music generation, mixing/playback) reflecting that all three components are equally critical to deliver the complete feature. Each story is independently testable with clear Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios. Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes like audio quality, intelligibility, and control responsiveness.

## Notes

**Validation Status**: All checklist items passed on first validation. Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` command.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear three-phase audio creation flow (voice → music → mix)
- Parallel generation opportunity identified (voice and music can be created simultaneously)
- Comprehensive playback control requirements
- User-focused success criteria (intelligibility, quality ratings, control usability)
- Appropriate assumptions about audio formats and file sizes

**Design Considerations Documented**:
- Auto-play behavior specified for seamless user experience
- Audio balance requirements ensure voice is intelligible
- Playback controls transform from disabled to functional state
- Integration with existing content generation from feature 003
- Generic instrumental allows reuse across all topics

**No Issues Found**: Specification meets all quality criteria for proceeding to planning phase. Edge cases provide good coverage of potential failure modes requiring clarification.
