# Feature Specification: Interactive Learning Homepage

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-homepage-with`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Let's build out the homepage to look like this attached image. You'll see it's primarily comprised of of two main sections - the 'let's learn about' and the 'with Ahmed da' Akademik' section. When the page first loads only the let's learn about should show. After typing what would you like to learn about - the bottom section shows, but only a spinner until an action completes (for now - you can have that be a simple 2 second pause, i'll add that functionality later)"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: When a user attempts to submit an empty or whitespace-only input, what should happen? → A: Disable submit button when input is invalid (proactive prevention)
- Q: After the 2-second loading spinner completes and disappears, what should appear in the "with Ahmed da' Akademik" section? → A: Mock audio player UI elements (play button, progress bar) in disabled state
- Q: Can users submit multiple learning topics in sequence (one after another), or is it a single-use interface? → A: Multiple submissions allowed - input resets after each submission, can keep submitting new topics
- Q: What are the minimum and maximum character limits for the learning topic input? → A: Min: 2 characters, Max: 300 characters (moderate limits)
- Q: When a user submits a new topic after the first one completes, what happens to the existing audio player section? → A: Replace completely - new loading spinner replaces old audio player, then new player appears

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enter Learning Topic (Priority: P1)

A user visits the Akademik homepage and wants to start learning about a specific topic. They see a clean, simple interface with a text input asking "What would you like to learn about?" They type their topic of interest and submit it to begin their learning session.

**Why this priority**: This is the core entry point for all users. Without the ability to enter a learning topic, the application has no functionality. This is the absolute minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the homepage, entering text in the input field, submitting the form, and verifying that the interface responds appropriately. Delivers immediate value by establishing the user's learning intent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user first loads the homepage, **When** the page renders, **Then** only the "let's learn about" input section is visible with a text input field and submit action
2. **Given** the input field is empty or contains only whitespace, **When** the user views the submit button, **Then** the button is disabled and cannot be clicked
3. **Given** the user types only 1 character, **When** the user views the submit button, **Then** the button remains disabled
4. **Given** the user sees the input section, **When** they type a learning topic with at least 2 characters into the field, **Then** the text appears in the input field as they type and the submit button becomes enabled
5. **Given** the user is typing in the input field, **When** they reach 300 characters, **Then** the input field prevents further character entry
6. **Given** the user has entered a valid learning topic, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the "with Ahmed da' Akademik" section appears below the input section
7. **Given** the user submits the form, **When** the second section appears, **Then** the input section remains visible above showing the submitted topic

### User Story 2 - Loading State Feedback (Priority: P2)

After submitting their learning topic, the user sees immediate feedback that their request is being processed. A loading spinner appears in the "with Ahmed da' Akademik" section, communicating that the system is working on their request and they should wait.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user experience and managing expectations. Without loading feedback, users may think the application is broken or click submit multiple times. This is the second priority because it depends on the input functionality being complete.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a learning topic and observing that a spinner appears in the audio player section. The spinner should be visible for the configured duration (2 seconds for initial implementation).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has submitted a learning topic, **When** the "with Ahmed da' Akademik" section appears, **Then** a loading spinner is immediately visible in that section
2. **Given** the loading spinner is displayed, **When** the user tries to interact with the input field, **Then** the input field and submit button are disabled
3. **Given** the loading spinner is displayed, **When** 2 seconds pass, **Then** the spinner disappears and is replaced by mock audio player UI elements
4. **Given** the audio player UI appears, **When** the user views it, **Then** they see disabled controls (play button, progress bar) indicating the player is not yet functional
5. **Given** the audio player UI appears, **When** the user looks at the input section, **Then** the input field is cleared and re-enabled for a new submission
6. **Given** an audio player is displayed and the user submits a new topic, **When** the new submission occurs, **Then** the existing audio player is completely replaced by a new loading spinner
7. **Given** the loading spinner is displayed, **When** the user looks at the interface, **Then** it's clear the system is processing their request

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Design and Layout (Priority: P3)

The homepage presents a clean, simple, and modern interface that resembles a conversational AI chat interface initially, then transitions to reveal an audio player aesthetic. The design avoids purple colors and uses a cohesive color scheme that feels professional and educational.

**Why this priority**: Visual design enhances user experience but the application is functional without perfect aesthetics. This can be refined after core functionality is working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visual inspection of the homepage in different states (initial load, after submission). Verify spacing, typography, color choices, and responsive behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user loads the homepage, **When** they view the interface, **Then** the design is clean and minimal with no purple colors
2. **Given** the user views the input section, **When** they assess the layout, **Then** it resembles a modern LLM chat interface with clear call-to-action
3. **Given** the audio player section appears, **When** the user views it, **Then** the layout transitions to suggest audio/media playback functionality
4. **Given** the user views the page on different screen sizes, **When** the viewport changes, **Then** the layout remains usable and visually appropriate

### Edge Cases

- **Empty or whitespace-only input**: Submit button is disabled when input field is empty or contains only whitespace characters, preventing invalid submissions proactively
- **Second submission during loading**: Input field and submit button are disabled while the spinner is showing, preventing multiple concurrent submissions
- **Multiple sequential submissions**: After the audio player appears, the input field resets and becomes ready for a new topic submission. When a new topic is submitted, the existing audio player is completely replaced by a new loading spinner and subsequent audio player
- **Input too short**: Topics with only 1 character are considered invalid; submit button remains disabled until at least 2 characters are entered
- **Input too long**: Text input is limited to 300 characters; users cannot type beyond this limit

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Key Entities

- **Learning Topic**: The subject matter the user wants to learn about, entered as free-form text with a minimum of 2 characters and maximum of 300 characters
- **Interface State**: The current view state of the homepage that determines which sections are visible and which controls are enabled. States include: initial (only input section visible), loading (both sections visible, input disabled, spinner showing), ready (both sections visible, input cleared and enabled, audio player showing)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can enter a learning topic and see the interface respond in under 1 second
- **SC-002**: The loading state provides clear visual feedback for the full 2-second duration
- **SC-003**: Users can identify where to enter their learning topic within 3 seconds of viewing the homepage
- **SC-004**: The interface remains visually clean and uncluttered throughout all interaction states
- **SC-005**: Users understand that their input was received and is being processed based on the loading state feedback

## Assumptions

- Users will primarily interact with the homepage on desktop and mobile browsers
- The 2-second loading delay is a temporary placeholder; real processing logic will be added later
- "Ahmed da' Akademik" is the persona/character providing the learning experience
- The audio player UI is a non-functional mock/placeholder; real playback functionality will be added later
- The disabled audio player controls provide visual feedback about the interface's future state
- Standard web browser text input capabilities are sufficient (no special input methods required)
- Users expect instant visual feedback similar to modern web applications
