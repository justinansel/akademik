# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Learning Homepage

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED - Ready for Planning

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on user interactions and outcomes without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches. Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 13 functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous. Success criteria include specific measurable metrics (time-based: 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds). Edge cases cover input validation scenarios. Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Three user stories prioritized by importance (P1: core input, P2: loading feedback, P3: visual design). Each story is independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Success criteria align with user story outcomes.

## Notes

**Validation Status**: All checklist items passed on first validation. Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` command.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear progressive disclosure pattern (input first, then audio player section)
- Well-defined edge cases for input validation
- Measurable success criteria focused on user experience timing
- Independent user stories that can be developed and tested separately
- Appropriate use of assumptions for technical decisions deferred to implementation

**No Issues Found**: Specification meets all quality criteria for proceeding to planning phase.
