# Feature Specification: Dynamic Visual Style Transformation

**Feature Branch**: `002-dynamic-visual-style`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'd like this app to change visual style as you move through it - to start when you have not pressed on the start learning button / have not submitted any information - it should look very clean and corporate - like an LMS or something in the technology sector. After you press start learning and when the 'With Ahmed...' section is done loading (currently when the audio placeholder appears) - it should morph the visual design to be something of the urban/streets/80s rap visual style - like a 'takeover' of the visual when you start learning"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: If a user submits a second topic while the visual transformation (0.5-1s) is still in progress, what should happen? → A: Complete current transformation first, then process new submission with urban style
- Q: When a user refreshes the page (at any point - before, during, or after transformation), what visual state should they see? → A: Always restart from corporate style (transformation state not persisted)
- Q: For users who have enabled reduced motion preferences in their browser/OS, how should the visual transformation behave? → A: Still show transformation but much slower (2-3 seconds) for better perception
- Q: For the urban/80s rap aesthetic with vibrant colors and bold contrasts, what specific color contrast approach should be used? → A: Apply vibrant colors everywhere but add text shadows/outlines to maintain readability
- Q: Which UI elements should remain unchanged (not transform) when the urban style is applied? → A: Everything transforms - no exceptions (complete visual takeover)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Corporate Initial Experience (Priority: P1)

A user visits the Akademik homepage for the first time and sees a clean, professional interface that resembles a modern Learning Management System or technology company platform. The visual style conveys trust, professionalism, and enterprise quality through its color palette, typography, and layout. This creates an appropriate first impression for an educational platform.

**Why this priority**: The initial visual impression sets user expectations and establishes credibility. A corporate aesthetic communicates that this is a serious learning platform, which is essential for user trust and engagement.

**Independent Test**: Load the homepage in initial state and verify all visual elements (colors, fonts, spacing, layout) match a corporate/LMS aesthetic. Compare against reference examples of professional learning platforms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user loads the homepage for the first time, **When** they view the interface, **Then** the color scheme uses professional blues, grays, and whites similar to enterprise software
2. **Given** the user views the initial interface, **When** they observe the typography, **Then** fonts are clean, professional, and highly readable (sans-serif, appropriate sizing)
3. **Given** the user views the layout, **When** they assess the spacing and structure, **Then** it follows corporate design patterns with ample whitespace and structured alignment
4. **Given** the user sees the input section, **When** they evaluate the visual style, **Then** it appears polished, minimal, and professional like a tech sector product

### User Story 2 - Visual Transformation Trigger (Priority: P1)

After a user submits their learning topic and the loading completes, the interface undergoes a dramatic visual transformation. The moment the audio player section appears (after the 2-second spinner), the entire interface "morphs" or "takes over" with a completely different aesthetic - shifting from corporate to urban/streets/80s rap styling. This transformation is smooth, intentional, and creates a memorable moment signaling the transition from setup to active learning.

**Why this priority**: The visual transformation is the core feature that differentiates this experience. It creates a unique brand moment and signals to users that they're moving from administrative setup into an engaging learning experience with personality.

**Independent Test**: Submit a topic, wait for loading to complete, and observe the visual transformation. Verify that colors, typography, visual effects, and overall aesthetic shift dramatically from corporate to urban/80s rap style.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has submitted a topic and the audio player appears, **When** the transformation occurs, **Then** the color palette shifts from corporate blues/grays to vibrant urban colors (graffiti-inspired tones, bold contrasts) applied liberally throughout with text shadows/outlines for readability
2. **Given** the transformation is triggered, **When** the user observes the change, **Then** typography transforms to bold, street-style fonts with more personality and edge
3. **Given** the visual takeover begins, **When** elements transition, **Then** the transformation happens smoothly over 0.5-1 second rather than instantly
4. **Given** the new style applies, **When** the user views the interface, **Then** visual elements suggest 80s rap aesthetic (bold borders, vintage effects, street culture references)
5. **Given** the transformation completes, **When** the user compares to initial state, **Then** the visual difference is dramatic and unmistakable - a complete stylistic "takeover"

---

### User Story 3 - Maintained Urban Aesthetic (Priority: P2)

Once the visual transformation to urban/80s rap styling has occurred, the interface maintains this aesthetic for all subsequent interactions. If the user submits additional topics, the urban style persists rather than reverting to corporate styling. The consistent urban aesthetic reinforces the learning experience and maintains the established visual identity.

**Why this priority**: Consistency after transformation is important for user experience, but the initial transformation (P1) is more critical. Users need to see the style persist across multiple submissions to feel the "takeover" is permanent.

**Independent Test**: After transformation occurs, submit additional learning topics and verify the urban aesthetic remains consistent throughout all states (input active, loading, audio player visible).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the interface has transformed to urban styling, **When** the user clears and re-enters the input field, **Then** the input section maintains the urban aesthetic rather than reverting to corporate
2. **Given** the user submits a second topic, **When** the loading spinner appears, **Then** it displays with urban styling consistent with the transformed aesthetic
3. **Given** multiple topics have been submitted, **When** the user views the interface, **Then** all visual elements consistently reflect the urban/80s rap styling
4. **Given** the urban style is active, **When** the user interacts with any element, **Then** hover states, focus states, and interactions use the urban design language

### Edge Cases

- **Transformation timing**: If the user submits a second topic while the transformation is in progress, the system completes the current transformation first, then processes the new submission with the urban style already applied
- **Page refresh behavior**: If the user refreshes the page at any point (before, during, or after transformation), the interface resets to the initial corporate style and the transformation must be triggered again
- **Reduced motion accessibility**: Users with prefers-reduced-motion enabled still see the visual transformation, but it occurs more slowly (2-3 seconds instead of 0.5-1 second) for better perception and reduced motion sensitivity
- **Color contrast with vibrant palette**: The urban aesthetic uses vibrant colors liberally throughout the interface, with text shadows and outlines applied to maintain readability and meet WCAG AA contrast standards
- **Complete visual takeover**: All UI elements transform to urban style with no exceptions - input fields, buttons, backgrounds, audio player, loading spinner, text, borders, shadows, and any other interface elements undergo the complete stylistic transformation

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-023**: System MUST apply vibrant colors liberally in the urban aesthetic (backgrounds, borders, decorative elements) while maintaining text readability through shadows and outlines

### Key Entities

- **Visual Theme State**: The current active visual style (corporate or urban) that determines the appearance of all UI elements
- **Transformation Trigger**: The event that initiates the visual style change (audio player appearance after loading)
- **Style Properties**: The collection of visual characteristics that define each aesthetic (colors, typography, spacing, effects)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can identify the initial interface as "corporate" or "professional" in visual style tests with 90%+ agreement
- **SC-002**: Users can identify the transformed interface as "urban" or "street-style" in visual style tests with 90%+ agreement
- **SC-003**: The visual transformation is noticeable to 95%+ of users without prompting
- **SC-004**: The transformation completes within 1 second of the audio player appearing for standard users, or within 3 seconds for users with reduced motion preferences
- **SC-005**: Users describe the transformation as "smooth" or "intentional" rather than "jarring" or "broken" in at least 80% of feedback
- **SC-006**: Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) in both visual states
- **SC-007**: The urban style persists correctly across 100% of subsequent topic submissions without reverting

## Assumptions

- The visual transformation occurs client-side and does not require server communication
- Both corporate and urban aesthetics follow the constitutional principle of "no purple colors"
- The 80s rap aesthetic draws from hip-hop culture visual elements (bold colors, graffiti art influence, vintage styling) without appropriating specific cultural symbols inappropriately
- Users are viewing the application in modern browsers that support CSS transitions and animations
- The transformation applies to the homepage only; other pages (if added later) maintain consistent styling
- Urban aesthetic includes bold, high-energy colors but maintains usability and readability
- Corporate aesthetic references modern tech company/SaaS design language (think Notion, Linear, modern LMS platforms)
- The transformation is a one-time event per page session - once urban, stays urban until page refresh, then resets to corporate
- Visual transformation does not affect the functionality of any interactive elements
